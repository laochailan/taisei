		HOW TO SET UP THE IDMAP FOR DUMMIES

		The idmap is used as a template to generate spellstage IDs in stage_init_array().
		It looks like this:

			{id_easy, id_normal, id_hard, id_lunatic}

		Where each of those IDs are in range of 0-127, and are unique within each stage-specific AttackInfo array.
		A special value of -1 can be used to not generate a spellstage for specific difficulties.
		This is useful if your spell is only available on Hard and Lunatic, or has a difficulty-dependent name, etc.

		Most importantly DO NOT CHANGE ENSTABILISHED IDs unless you absolutely must.
		Doing so is going to break replays, progress files, and anything that stores stage IDs permanently.
		Stage IDs are an internal detail invisible to the player, so they don't need to have any kind of fancy ordering.
