	RIGHT("No, that’s not it. We already have a more suitable candidate from our concerned Celestials, and she is due to arrive instead.");
	RIGHT("That means you can go home.");
	LEFT("Absolutely not. I’ve worked too hard to get here, so even if I’d like to leave, it’d be far too much wasted time.");

	LEFT("You seem to know who I am, just like that earlier yōkai did. I can’t say the same for myself.");
	RIGHT("That is because we met before in another time, when you were much younger…");
	RIGHT("Back then, I was a mere guard. But then my master left Kurumi and I behind. We fell into the real world instead of Gensōkyō,");
	RIGHT("and I realized that logic was far superior to the chaos of fantasy.");
	LEFT("Do you really think it’s acceptable to threaten Gensōkyō just for some petty delusion of intelligence?");
	RIGHT("An unenlightened fool like you could never see how your faith blinds you.");
	LEFT("You talk big but in the end you’re just a yōkai who is full of herself. It doesn’t matter how smart your world is if it threatens mine.");
	LEFT("I’ll tear everything down all the same.");
