Taisei

1. Introduction

Taisei is an open clone of the Touhou series. Touhou is a one-man project of
shoot-em-up games set in an isolated world full of Japanese folklore.

2. Installation

Dependencies:
	- SDL, SDL_ttf
	- libpng
	- OpenGL
	- OpenAL, ALUT
	- CMake (build system)

To build and install Taisei just follow these steps.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$yourprefix ..
make
make install

This will install game data to $prefix/share/taisei/ and build this path
_statically_ into the executable. This might be a package maintainer's choice.
Alternatively you may want to add -DRELATIVE=TRUE to get a relative structure
like

$prefix/taisei
$prefix/data/
($prefix/config)

RELATIVE is always set when building for Windows.
