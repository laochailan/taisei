comment = The fifth stage’s theme.\n\nAnd back again… how did that song go? “No reason to get excited…”\n\nBut in honesty, this is a combination of Eastern and Western influences now. If it were like a pendulum up to this point, then this theme is like an oscillating electric current.\n\nThose who climb risk a long fall, so look to the top and don’t make a single dishonest step.
