comment = Elly’s first theme.\n\nAn old friend. I always found myself inspired by the idea of a completely inconsequential character from forgotten times climbing to great heights after fading into obscurity.\n\nShe may have been a lowly gate guard the last time you saw her, but the apple’s fallen on her head. She’s a guard of a different kind of gate now.
