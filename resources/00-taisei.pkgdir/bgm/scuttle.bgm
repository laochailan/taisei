comment = A secret theme for a most beloved character…\n\nI wanted to play with the concept of Scuttle’s motif as heard in the tunnel of light and try to apply it to a full-length song.\n\nThe results were interesting! Her theme is as much an experiment as her existence.\n\nSupposing she were to appear as a boss, I think it might sound different given a different role in the incident.
