comment = The decision to arrange a character’s existing theme or to come up with something entirely new is difficult and likely one ZUN himself struggles with.\n\nI know my strengths lie in the latter, which ultimately resulted in the stormy composition usually heard at the top of the tower, but Iku has such an interesting original theme I had to at least accept the challenge.\n\nUltimately, I can’t decide if I did the original justice with this one or not, but I know it holds a special place in my heart.
