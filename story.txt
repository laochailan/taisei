================================================================================


  ○ Kirisame Marisa

    Because it’s a fan game after all.

    Just at the beginning of spring, Marisa went to check the shop’s shelves,
    only to notice that her cash box was as empty as the shop itself. Usually,
    at least a few customers would show up eventually, but not that day.

    She was really bored.

    After a quick glance around the store, a brand new issue of the Bunbunmaru
    Newspaper that was lying on the table caught her eyes. At least that one is
    never late.

        “News Exclusive: Border Broken?!”

    Her eyes flashed in excitement as she read on.

        “[…] large gathering of curious yōkai […]”

    “Okay, I’ll better check it out!”, she thought, happy about having found a
    better pastime than looking after her depressingly empty shop.

    “Time to spark some ass!”


  ○ Konpaku Yōmu

    Because Yōmu is awesome.

    A blossomless spring dawn in the Netherworld. Shattering noises cut through
    the gardens of passed souls. Noises not even ghosts can enjoy.
    This ending night was in fact nothing like a normal night. The entire
    Netherworld was awake early, including Yuyuko-sama and of course a certain
    half-phantom girl.

    “I cannot sleep like this. Can the restless not have at least this kind of
    rest? Something really needs to be done about this, or I will go insane.”

    “Of course, Yuyuko-sama. I shall slash every little clangor in this world
    until your sleep is left undisturbed!”

    The fact that Hakugyokurō is closely connected to the border makes it
    sensitive to changes of the border’s structure. Yōmu was aware of that,
    which led her to the decision to investigate this “border breaking” rumor
    first.

■ 4. Bosses
================================================================================

  ○ Stage 1 Boss
    Cirno

    Clueless about the course of events, she still jumps into action with full
    force. Her reckless courage may seem like foolishness to others, but she is
    bound and determined to bend history in her favor.



  ○ Stage 2 Boss
    Kagiyama Hina

    Hina was the first considerably strong yōkai to show up at the place of
    action, which is why she ended up as the inofficial overseer of the growing
    crowd. Actually, the only thing she wanted was to maintain a bit of law and
    order in her forest.



  ○ Stage 3 Boss
    Wriggle

    When half-yōkai like Wriggle gain a reasonable amount of power, it is only
    natural for them to become a bit overconfident. Fortunately, that alone
    wasn’t enough for her to become the final boss.

    The story doesn’t take place underground after all.



  ○ Stage 4 Boss
    Kurumi

    She is a friend of Elly’s… or at least her former kōhai. Some time ago,
    Elly dragged her along when she left her mansion to set out on a longer
    journey, and now they have returned. Still trying her best at keeping all
    the curious yōkai (and players) who are entering from the tunnel off
    Elly’s back, she grew tired of being her bodyguard long ago.

    Somehow they’ve really taken a liking to each other.



  ○ Stage 5 Boss
    Nagae Iku

    She slipped through the guard right after the player. No one knows what
    she is after, but there are two things she hates:

    Being interrupted when she is in a hurry and always being suspected for
    everything.

    Both happening at the same time has made her lose her temper.
    But that makes her seem even more suspicious, doesn't it?



  ○ Stage 6 Boss
    Elly

    She quit her task of guarding that mation in Lotus Land Story and obtained
    a new power from the outside world: the power to manipulate relations
    (i.e. she can do fancy maths). This enabled her to trick Gensōkyō’s border*
    and create herself a new place for research using her new powers.

    On that high tower, she wants to research The Theory of Everything.

    Maybe she didn’t even plan to use it to anyone’s harm. She certainly didn’t
    expect the location she chose for her tower to cause that much trouble.
    But that’s what scientists are like. Research comes first.

    Her spellcards are based on physical phenomena, turning her experiments
    into powerful weapons.

    Fun Fact™: Taisei actually uses complex math for projectile positioning.


    * It’s not like the border is an absolute barrier for yōkai. It is not
      uncommon for powerful yōkai to pass through there without much trouble.
      Some even visit the outside world regularly to hunt humans for food.
      But Elly broke it at some place and made it lead to her own place
      *somewhere inbetween*, which is unusual and shouldn’t be easily possible.
